This repository contains my work from the Cyber Security Internship at Future Interns.
The task focused on performing a web application vulnerability assessment on live public-facing websites and intentionally vulnerable applications. 

📌 Overview

Websites are often vulnerable due to outdated plugins, misconfigured headers, or exposed information. This project focuses on:

Identifying security weaknesses ethically

Communicating risks in business-friendly terms

Suggesting actionable remediation steps

Presenting a polished vulnerability assessment report

Note: This project is purely read-only — no hacking or harmful activity.

⚖️ Scope

✅ Public-facing pages only
✅ Passive scanning & header checks
✅ Configuration analysis

❌ No exploitation, brute force, DoS, or login bypass

🛠️ Tools Used

Nmap – Port & exposure analysis

OWASP ZAP (Passive Scan) – Safe vulnerability scanning

Browser DevTools – Header, cookie, and client-side inspection

Canva – Professional report design

🌟 Learning Outcomes

Ethical vulnerability assessment

Communicating security risks clearly

Professional cybersecurity reporting
